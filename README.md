The assignment covers regression (both linear and logistic) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, focusing on predicting the "Chance of Admit" for university applicants based on various factors.

Assignment Objectives
Data Preparation and Scaling: Load and preprocess data, handle missing values, and apply appropriate scaling.
Dimensionality Reduction with LDA: Use LDA for feature extraction to improve model efficiency and interpretability.
Linear Regression on LDA-Transformed Data: Compare models using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.
Logistic Regression: Implement multi-class logistic regression to categorize admission chances.
Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation: Use techniques like grid search and k-fold cross-validation to optimize model performance.
Requirements
Python libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and OS.
